/**
 * A platform with two protecting signals throws BOTH of them.
 *
 * MT-023, Adam: "Does not work - only first is set to red. Selection process is ok."
 *
 * A station may be reachable from each end, so it may be protected by a signal on each approach. They
 * are commanded together and show the same aspect - they say the same thing about the same platform -
 * and a platform guarded at one end and open at the other is worse than one guarded at neither,
 * because it looks protected.
 *
 * **Why this test is at the layout rather than in the editor.** Reading the chain settled where it is
 * NOT: the store keeps a list, `protectingSignalNames` maps every one of them, the builder writes one
 * as a bare string and several as an array, `fromJSON` reads both shapes back (testAutoLayout covers
 * that), and the aspect is memoised per ACCESSORY rather than per Point - with a comment recording that
 * keying it per Point was itself a bug, because one copy of a square wrote a memo while standing empty
 * and the signal stayed green with a train at the platform.
 *
 * Every link handles several. What no test covered was the end of the chain actually being reached for
 * more than one - which is exactly what "only first is set to red" describes.
 *
 * `refreshAllProtectingSignals` is public and asks each signal directly, without the "only while
 * running" guard that protects the per-occupancy path, so this needs no trains and no hardware.
