/**
 * Renders the real diagram to a picture, so that questions about how it LOOKS can be answered by
 * looking rather than by reading the painting code.
 *
 * Written 2026-08-22 after a run of defects that were all about pixels - a caption three tiles wide, a
 * star hidden under a badge, a star swallowed by its own outline - each of which took two or three
 * rounds because they were diagnosed by reading `paint` methods and reasoning. Every one of them would
 * have been obvious in a picture.
 *
 * `DiagramExport.render` already builds one offscreen: it is what the export feature uses, it goes
 * through the same LayoutGrid and the same TileAnnotation as the window, and it needs no visible frame.
 *
 * **This is a tool as much as a test.** The assertions below are deliberately weak - they check the
 * picture exists and is not blank - because their job is to keep the harness working. The value is the
 * PNG it leaves in the build folder, which a person or an agent can then open.
