# What the railway does, and why

This is the intended behaviour of the features that decide where trains may go and what happens when
they get there. It is written to be **read against the code and disagreed with**: where this document
and the program differ, one of them is a bug, and Adam decides which.

Every rule below is Adam's, quoted where the wording matters. Rules that were argued over carry the
date and the case that settled them, because several were reversed once and a rule without its reason
gets reversed again by the next person who finds it inconvenient.

**What this is not.** It is not a description of the code's structure, and it is not a changelog. It
says what the railway should do. Where a rule has a known limit — something it deliberately does not
catch — the limit is stated, because a limit nobody wrote down reads as a bug the day it is met.

## 1. The three tiers: autonomy, manual, Return Home

Three things move trains, and they do **not** obey the same rules. Most of the confusion this
document exists to prevent comes from assuming they do.

| | chooses its own destinations | may go where autonomy is told not to | asks the operator anything |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Autonomy** | yes | no | never |
| **Manual** (right-click, Locomotive tab) | no — the operator chooses | yes | yes, about reversals |
| **Return Home** | no — the planner chooses | **yes** | never |

**Return Home sits with Manual on the question of where a train may be sent.** This was got wrong
once and corrected on 2026-09-06: `isAutoDestination` appears nowhere in `HomeStaging`, and Adam's
earlier ruling stands — *"Return Home still fills it; only full autonomy leaves it alone."* The Path
Type control in the editor says Manual for this reason.

**One difference remains between Return Home and a manual send**, and it is deliberate (confirmed
2026-09-07): Return Home refuses to start a train standing on an **inactive** square, where a manual
send allows it. The exemption exists for a person who has looked at the railway and decided to move
that train now; Return Home is a plan made for every staged locomotive at once, and quietly driving
out of a square somebody switched off is the opposite of what switching it off meant.

## 2. Inactive squares

> *"Inactive really means nothing can pass."* — Adam, 2026-09-06

An inactive square is refused as a **destination** and as an **intermediate** point, in every tier.

**The square a train is already standing on is exempt.** Switching a square off around a train is how
you take it out of service; the train then has to be driven off it by hand, and a rule that refused
that would strand it.

---

## 3. Reversals

### Where a train turns round

A square is several `Point`s — one per side a train can arrive by — and **which copy a train is on IS
its direction**. Three kinds of square matter:

- **A terminus.** The train has run out of track. It turns, and nobody is asked. A train that
  *cannot* reverse may still **back into** a terminus, when the route there turns it round
  (Adam, MT-245).
- **A compulsory turn** (`mustReverse`). Every copy turns trains. Not a question in any tier: a
  turning copy's only outgoing edges leave by the side the train arrived from, so *not* turning is
  not an available outcome — it drives the train forward off its reserved path.
- **A may-reverse square** (`canReverse`). The build splits it into a plain copy and a turning one.
  Autonomy turns only where the flag says. **Manual always asks.**

### The question, and when it is asked

> *"May reverse should always prompt in manual mode. It should be a yes/no keep direction, with no
> meaning change, and yes being default."* — 2026-09-06
>
> *"Make it be on departure itself, that way there is no dispatch prior to user input."* — 2026-09-06

- Asked **once per journey**, **before the train moves**, from both manual doors (the track diagram
  and the Locomotive commands tab).
- The dialog names the **destination** when that is one of the squares in question, because *"send a
  train to a may-reverse point"* is the case the feature exists for.
- **Yes = keep the current direction**, and it is the default. Escape, the window's X, and a dialog
  that cannot be shown all mean keep. Only an explicit **No** turns the train.
- **A journey ending at a terminus is not asked about at all**, because the answer would be
  discarded: the turn on the way in is how a train backs into a terminus.
- Autonomy and Return Home are never asked.

### What the runtime cannot answer

`canReverse` never reaches the running layout — `AutonomyBuilder` expresses it by splitting the
square and says so. So the door supplies the "is this square one the operator has a say over"
question from the **setup**, and nothing in the automation layer can answer it. A policy that
answers it from `isReversing()` cannot tell a may-reverse square from a compulsory turn, and that
mistake has been made in both directions.

### Direction commands

- **Changing the direction on the graph does not command the track.**
- **A direction command from the track DOES update the graph**, if it disagrees — and a reversal made
  *during* a run is followed once the run ends, not discarded.
- A reversal at a may-reverse square emits exactly the same command a terminus does.

## 4. Which way a train is pointing, and where its tail is

Two different properties, and confusing them was the cause of a day's worth of defects.

- **`facing`** — the side the train's front points at. It is which copy of the square the train
  stands on, and it decides where it can go next.
- **`arrivedFrom`** — the side it came IN by. Its tail lies that way.

**Facing cannot answer where the tail is.** A train faces the way it will leave; once it has been
turned round the two point the same way while the carriages have not moved.

### How `arrivedFrom` is set

- **Autonomy writes it on arrival**, which is the only moment anything knows it for certain — and
  before any reversal at the platform, because turning a train does not move its carriages.
- **A hand placement works it out**: a terminus forces it (one way in); an ordinary station assumes
  the opposite of the facing (a train that has not been turned drove in forwards); **a may-reverse
  square asks**, because turning round is what those squares are for and the train is as likely to
  have backed in as driven in.
- It can be set or cleared afterwards from **Train arrived from** in the right-click menu, on both
  the editor and the track diagram.
- Not knowing is a legitimate answer. It does **not** mean nothing is blocked: where the geometry
  leaves only one way back, the walk still follows it, because that answer is forced rather than
  guessed. `arrivedFrom` picks between candidates; it is not a switch that turns blocking on.
  (Corrected 2026-09-07 after `VAL8-C1` — the earlier wording claimed less than the code does.)

### Pasting a train

> *"Calculate the simple BFS path from the current station to the paste target using the current
> direction. Paste with the direction where the train ends up at the destination. If no path, pick
> randomly from the allowed departure destinations."* — Adam, 2026-09-06

The heading is not carried and not inferred from the two squares: **the railway is walked**. Which
way a train ends up facing is decided by the track between the two platforms and by which way it set
off — one that leaves southbound round a loop is northbound one square away. A square with one copy
has one answer, which at a terminus is the reversal.

---

## 5. Length: will the train fit?

Two separate rules, both about length, both easy to mistake for each other.

### 5a. Room at the berth

A train is refused a **terminus or reversing** destination it does not fit in.

- The room is measured **from the last switch** to the berth. A train that fits there fits behind any
  earlier switch too; one that does not comes to rest standing on the switch.
- **Exactly-fits is admitted.** Four units of room takes a four-unit train — otherwise every berth
  measured to the train that lives in it becomes unusable.
- **The total across the stretch is what counts**, not any single tile: 2 + 2 admits a four-unit
  train, 1 + 2 does not.

### 5b. What "unmeasured" means

> *"You need to measure total distance between points, not validate that every edge has a length > 0.
> It is only indeterminate if the entire logical segment has length 0."* — Adam, 2026-09-06
>
> *"Generally, allow it. But: the example ... has measured segments before (that prevent it) ... Make
> sure you are actually enforcing this."* — Adam, 2026-09-06

- Unmeasured track contributes **no room**. It does not follow that it contributes **no answer**.
- A stretch where **nothing at all** is measured is not judged — the train is allowed. Refusing on no
  information would make an unmeasured layout unusable.
- Where part is measured, **the measured part still binds**: an unmeasured segment must not cancel a
  refusal the measured ones already earned.
- **A stretch is bounded by the segment it lies in.** If the room after the last switch is unmeasured
  but the segment measures one unit, a four-unit train does not fit — a part cannot be longer than
  the whole. This over-states the real room, so it only ever refuses more; nothing new is admitted.

### 5c. The tail: track a standing train is lying across

> *"Those edges it reaches need to be considered blocked ... bottommainc should currently be blocked
> since a train of length 4 is standing at bottommainb, which has a length of 1 leading up to its
> switch."* — Adam, 2026-09-06

- **Edges, not points** — *"because the points are technically unoccupied. But the blocked edges
  should prevent routing to the covered points."* A station reachable only across covered track
  becomes unreachable as a consequence, rather than by a second rule that could disagree.
- The walk starts at the side recorded in `arrivedFrom` and follows track **regardless of direction**
  — a tail fouls the rail whichever way traffic runs.
- **It stops at a fork.** *"If entering a switch from the fork direction where it splits, just end
  locking at the switch and call it a day."* One way back means the tail certainly lies there;
  several means the graph cannot say which.
- **It stops at unmeasured track.** Only positive lengths are determinate.
- A train never blocks itself — pulling forward off its own tail is how it leaves.
- Covered squares are **greyed on the diagram** until the train moves.

**Known limits, deliberately.** A tail that really does reach past a fork, or across unmeasured
track, is not blocked. Both under-claim. Blocking on a guess is still a refusal, and it stops trains
that could have run.

---

## 6. Parking and Return Home

- Return Home stages every locomotive that has a home, as one plan.
- One locomotive has one home; assigning a home takes it away from wherever it was.
- It refuses an inactive **start** (see §1) and obeys every length rule in §5.
- It never asks the operator anything: the operator's decision was made when the homes were set.

---

## 7. Routing checks in the editor

**Path Type (Auto / Manual)** decides which tier the check answers for. The two differ **only** in
where a train may be sent: an inactive square stops both, a barred arrival stops both, a compulsory
turn turns both.

On **Auto**, a station autonomy is told to leave alone is reported as reachable **and never chosen** —
which is the state somebody opens the panel to explain. The route is still drawn, because the track
is passable and reporting "no path" would be a lie about the railway to make a point about the
settings.

---

## 8. Things that are true of the whole system

- **A square is several Points.** Anything reasoning about "the station" must say which copy it
  means, or it is asking a question the graph does not answer.
- **`canReverse` is not in the running layout.** Only the setup knows it.
- **Facing is encoded as one-way edges.** There is no direction field on a train's route; the sparse
  and doubled edges *are* the direction.
- **Signals and switches are the same device.** `accessoryType` is display-only.
- **Occupancy and reservation are different facts.** A route holds track it intends to use; a
  standing train covers track it is lying on. Neither is the other.

## Where this document came from

Written 2026-09-07 at Adam's request, after a run of sessions in which the same rules were
re-litigated because nothing stated them in one place. Several were reversed during that work — the
Return Home tier, the meaning of an unmeasured segment, and whether a compulsory turn is a question —
and each reversal is recorded above with the case that forced it.

The review documents in `docs/reviews/` are the working record of how these rules were arrived at.
This is the answer they were working towards.
